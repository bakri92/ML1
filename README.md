## Instructions
### Installation
Clone this repo onto your machine with the following command in your terminal:  
```
git clone git@gitlab.tubit.tu-berlin.de:dettmar/ML1.git
```  
The repo will be cloned into the folder `ML1/`

### Project file structure
In order to keep our project file structure relatively clean; once you're ready to upload your `.ipynb` file, copy paste it (not the whole folder) into the right exercise folder (`exercise01/`, `exercise02/`, etc), rename it as follows:
```sheet01_<your first name>.ipynb```

This way it'll be relatively easy to overview each others contributions without overwriting each others files.
